## How to play

Connect the yellow gear to the driving green gears with some of the falling gears to make it spin. Once you have, you wil advance to a new level (see counter in the bottom right).

If a gear is conflicted about which way it should move (e.g. if three moving gears are in mutual contact) it will break.

Hit space to reset the level. Page up and page down can be used to skip through levels.
